                <h2>Prime Minister of India</h2>
                <p><b>Narendra Modi</b> is a prominent Indian politician who has made a significant impact on the country's political landscape. Born on September 17, 1950, in Vadnagar, Gujarat, Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and has been associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organization. He rose from humble beginnings to become the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014, during which time the state experienced notable economic growth. However, his tenure was also marked by controversy due to criticism surrounding the handling of the 2002 Gujarat riots. In May 2014, Modi assumed the role of Prime Minister of India after the BJP secured a decisive victory in the general elections, securing a second term in 2019. His leadership has been characterized by economic reforms, foreign policy initiatives, and digital programs, but it has also faced criticism for issues such as religious tensions and concerns about freedom of expression and economic inequality. Narendra Modi remains a polarizing figure in Indian politics, known for his charismatic leadership and influence on the nation's policies and development.</p>
